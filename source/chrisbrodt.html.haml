  %h3 Summary
  %hr
  %p
    I've been writing computer code off and on for 20 years, starting with a pretty sweet Tandy 1000 HX and GW-BASIC while growing up in Oklahoma City.
    Faster, more interesting, computers were purchased and my coding skills lay dormant until I picked up a job doing some web development at my University.  While I greatly
    enjoyed studying Political Science and Philosophy, my love of programming and developing software was re-kindled.  After leaving University I moved to Jacksonville, FL
    where I've taken various roles as a programmer, manager, and software architect.
